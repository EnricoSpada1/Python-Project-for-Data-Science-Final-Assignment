# Python-Project-for-Data-Science-Final-Assignment

In this project I've applied Python library like "yfinance" to extract data, Beautiful Soup for parsing structured data, and typical process of Python programming language like Webscraping to extract data from the web. At the end, I've displayed with a Python function the graphs of stock data of two companies.
